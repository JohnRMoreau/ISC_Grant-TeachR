## Proposal: Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry TeachR Online Modules

R is in high demand - an ever increasing number of people from various
domains are keen to learn it and further improve their skills. While
there is an enormous amount of R teaching material, commercial as well
as
[freely available](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/),
qualified instructors who possess skills in R and in effective
teaching methodology, is not widely available.

#### The plan

> How are you going to solve the problem? Include the concrete actions you will take and an estimated timeline. What are likely failure modes and how will you recover from them?


We propose developing interactive modules to teach introductory R skills. These modules using the SCORM content standard and published under a Creative Commons license. Our materials would integrate the Software Carpentry\Data Carpentry approach to pedagogy with best practices in online education and high-impact educational technology. These modules would use the SCORM content standard so that faculty could integrate them into their institutions' existing learning management systems. Our primary audience would be instructors looking to include statistical programming into existing classes. Additionally, some instructors might use these lessons as part of a new class to teach statistical computing in a semester-long format. Finally, we would also host user-facing implementations of the content on our website. Such an implementation would greatly expand the potential reach of the project. 

These materials would benefit students, faculty, SwC\DC, and the larger R community. Learners would get the tools they need to not just do class assignments but to start coding for their own research. Faculty would have robust instructional materials designed to meet or exceed the Quality Matters certification standards (https://www.qualitymatters.org/rubric) when deployed as part of a well-designed course. Our organization would receive greater visibility across a number of disciplines and increased interest in intermediate\advanced workshops on R. Finally, the R community would see an influx of new users, first as students adopt R for their coursework, then later as those students bring their R skills into the workforce.

#### How can the ISC help

> What can we do to help you? If you need money, how much? How will

> but we will consider funding travel and equipment if you have good
> justification. How can we help promote your project? How else could
> we help?

Hodor Hodor Hodor Hodor Hodor Hodor Hodor Hodor Hodor Hodor Hodor Hodor Hodor Hodor Hodor Hodor Hodor Hodor Hodor Hodor Hodor Hodor Hodor Hodor Hodor Hodor We would like to request financial support from the ISC to organise
and promote the courses. Possibly also with IT to run the online course. Hodor Hodor Hodor Hodor Hodor Hodor Hodor Hodor Hodor Hodor Hodor Hodor Hodor Hodor Hodor Hodor Hodor Hodor Hodor Hodor 


#### Budget

> Please note that the budget for the ISC is currently limited. We are
> likely to fund one or two projects with a budget of $20-30k
> projects, and handful of projects with budgets of of $5-10k. We do
> not pay overhead.

#### Dissemination

> How will you ensure that your work is available to the widest number
> of people? What open source license will you use? How will host your
> code so that others can contribute? How will you publicise your
> work? We encourage you to plan at least two blog posts to the R
> consortium blog: once to announce the project, and one to write up
> what you achieved.
