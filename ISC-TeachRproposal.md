## Proposal: Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry TeachR Online Modules

### The problem

> What problem do you want to solve? Why is it a problem? Who does it
> affect? What will solving the problem enable? This section should
> include a brief summary of existing work, such as other packages. If
> you are proposing a change to R itself, you must include a letter of
> support from a member of R core.

#### Student and Instructor Experience
R is in high demand - an ever increasing number of people from various domains are keen to learn it and further improve their skills. While there is an enormous amount of passive teaching material, most of it focuses on self-motivated, individual learners. Very little material currently exists for academic instructors looking to incorporate R into their existing classes. Too often, instructors may briefly introduce statistical programming with a single, hurried lecture or by posting a few reference materials to the course website. Students  must then struggle through teaching themselves how to program, without feedback or guidance. As a result, students develop an incomplete understanding of how to use statistical software. They may come to believe that they cannot do statistics, that they are not "a math person".  For instructors,  using passive instructional materials means that either they cannot measure students' understanding or must invest significant time to develop their own assessments. All of these headaches combine to deter instructors from teaching useful data analysis skills and to demoralize students.

#### Competitive Disadvantage
Currently, R is at a competitive disadvantage compared to other statistical environments. Commercial software packages, such as SPSS and SAS, have academic outreach programs targeted at course instructors. These programs offer assistance with every aspect of course design. Instructors can easily find instructors' notes, pre-made presentations, practice exercises, and even whole courses. Through its [Global Academic Program](http://support.sas.com/learn/ap/prof/index.html#t3) SAS even offers free hands-on workshops for university faculty wanting to teach SAS in their classes. For many students, the software they use in university will influence what software they choose in the professional careers for years to come. In order to compete with proprietary commercial statistical environments, R must have a robust and easy-to-use set of instructional materials available.      

### The plan

> How are you going to solve the problem? Include the concrete actions you will take and an estimated timeline. What are likely failure modes and how will you recover from them?


We propose developing interactive modules to teach introductory R skills. These modules using the SCORM content standard and published under a Creative Commons license. Our materials would integrate the Software Carpentry\Data Carpentry approach to pedagogy with best practices in online education and high-impact educational technology. These modules would use the SCORM content standard so that faculty could integrate them into their institutions' existing learning management systems. Our primary audience would be instructors looking to include statistical programming into existing classes. Additionally, some instructors might use these lessons as part of a new class to teach statistical computing in a semester-long format. Finally, we would also host user-facing implementations of the content on our website. Such an implementation would greatly expand the potential reach of the project. 

These materials would benefit students, faculty, SwC\DC, and the larger R community. Learners would get the tools they need to go beyond class assignments and start coding on their own. Faculty would have robust instructional materials designed to meet or exceed the Quality Matters certification standards (https://www.qualitymatters.org/rubric) when deployed as part of a well-designed course. Our organization would receive greater visibility across a number of disciplines and increased interest in intermediate\advanced workshops on R. Finally, the R community would see an influx of new users, first as students adopt R for their coursework, then later as those students bring their R skills into the workforce. 


#### Concrete Actions
- Planning Stage
  - Define learning objectives (using existing learning objectives as starting point)
  - Develop assessment and feedback strategies
  - Determine which lessons to convert (We currently have multiple lessons for introductory R using different data sets)
  - Identify additional content needed for learning objectives
  - Divide and sequence content into manageable chunks (units and lessons) to decrease cognitive burden
  - Refine diversity and inclusion strategy
  - Validate planning with key stakeholders 
  
- Development Stage
  - Create storyboards to outline each unit and lesson
  - Design consistent graphical elements and layout to facilitate effective learning
  - Recruit volunteers for video recordings, screen-cast narrations, and writing assessment questions
  - Develop any media (slides, graphics, etc.) necessary for volunteer recordings
  - Manage volunteer progress on recordings
  - Develop other media for lessons - interactive assessments, wrappers (intro/exit graphics), navigation pages, etc.
  - Compile elements into lessons for beta testing
  
- Testing Stage
  - For this project, we will borrow from the agile development framework
  - Work will take place in two week sprints, with concrete targets for each sprint 
  - Our goal will be getting lessons ready for user acceptance testing as soon as possible
  - Testing will take place in parallel with development in order to respond quickly to feedback

### How can the ISC help

> but we will consider funding travel and equipment if you have good
> justification. How can we help promote your project? How else could
