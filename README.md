# ICS proposal for interactive R teaching materials 

The R consortium invites the community to submit
[ISC Proposals](https://www.r-consortium.org/about/isc/proposals):

> The goal of the Infrastructure Steering Committee (the ISC) is to
> support projects that broadly help the R community. This might be
> software development, developing new teaching materials, documenting
> best practices, standardising APIs or doing research. Currently, the
> ISC chiefly provides financial support for projects proposed by
> individuals or teams who have the skills to carry out the work, but
> we can also provide administrative support, promotion and some
> collaboration tools for groups who would like to study more
> ambitious projects.

### Summary

Suggestion: Funding to develop interactive online modules to teach R based on the proven curriculum and pedagogy of Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry. Modules would be designed for easy implementation in Learning Management Systems (LMS), such as Blackboard and Moodle. The core audiences would be individual learners, past workshop participants looking to expand their skills, and college-level instructors looking to integrate statistical computing into their courses without taking class time.
